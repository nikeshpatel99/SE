In order to access the system, do not attempt run a local copy using node. This would require ssh keys/private token files that are not provided.
Instead, navigate to https://gregstretton.org (no 'www'). The Keystone CMS can be accessed at https://gregstretton.org/keystone
Login details for keystone are as follows: Email: 'example@pvcc.co.uk' Password: 'mistreat agree appear reputation8'

There exists a database hosted online, however it requires an ssh key to access. If you would like to see it, contact me at nikesh.patel@durham.ac.uk and 
I will give you access - though all the data stored in the database is accessable through keystone.

There is also a service account that receives the booking enquiries and is linked to the facility calendars- if you would like to look at this the login details are as follows:
Email: 'group6.se.durham@gmail.com' , Password: 'ZUs9fjfbCSNBKhdC'
